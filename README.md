You are a cute alien on a planet full of other aliens. There are tons of ways to get resources, like killing monsters, mining, exploring, etc. With those coins you can get gadgets and weapons that make you more powerful. The game is under development and I am planing to publish it on steam.
Currently I have a lobby,where you can buy items (a cube, a grappler gun, a pistol and a knockback gun) and a cave where you can buy potions (speed and jomp boost, the rest is in development).
There is also a cave that every time it generates randomly. For the cave I used procedual generation and marching cubes.
There is another scene that you can not acces in game where I am working on forest generation also with procedual generation and marching cubes.
In the last scene that you can't acces where I am working and learning about A* pathfinding.
#The game is free on https://bandys.itch.io/p505.
